## PaperBee ##
PaperBee is an android app which can save your thoughts, ideas and to-do lists right on your phone.
Nothing is synchronized and data never leaves your phone. Keep your ideas for you

### What's next for PaperBee ? ###
Here is a small non-exhaustive list of the features most likely to be released
- Translations
- More elements in notes such as links
- Interface tweaks and additions
- NFC sharing

### Database Storage versions ###
Database storage is experimental. This is NOT compatible with the old save format within the app neither through backups. The only way to transfer your old notes is to copy paste their content to a file and copy paste from this file in new notes after updating the app. Here is the list of all known bugs related to these experimental features:
- Moving nested NoteParts doesn't work properly (when moving them up)
- Imports and Exports are disabled (they have to be reworked on)
- Deleting nested NoteParts makes the app crash (but everything is saved)
